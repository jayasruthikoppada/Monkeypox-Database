Monkeypox Database Management System

# Project Overview
The "Monkeypox Database Management System (DBMS)" is designed to provide a comprehensive, centralized platform for preserving, retrieving, and analyzing information about the Monkeypox virus. This project aims to facilitate real-time monitoring of viral transmission and infection cases, enabling health organizations and governmental bodies to respond promptly and effectively to outbreaks.

The system integrates functionalities for data visualization, analysis, and reporting, aiding public health authorities, researchers, and healthcare professionals in better understanding and combating the disease.

# Features
- Database Design: 
  - Developed using MySQL to manage and query data effectively.
  - Includes tables such as `Total Cases`, `Total Deaths`, `New Cases`, and `New Deaths`.
  - Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for database schema representation.

- Frontend Development: 
  - Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
  - Dynamic user input handling and visual presentation.

- Backend Development: 
  - Server-side scripting with PHP for robust database operations and data integration.
  - Supports functionalities like form handling, data visualization, and API documentation.

- Visualization:
  - Utilized Python for generating graphical representations of data:
    - Bar charts for cases and deaths by country.
    - Line graphs to track cases over time

 Tools & Technologies
- Languages: MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
- Data Source: World Health Organization (WHO)
- Visualization: Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib)

 Results
The project successfully:
- Created a DBMS to store and manage Monkeypox-related data.
- Developed visualizations for tracking the virus's spread and analyzing trends.
- Built an interactive web application for data access and reporting.
